USER INTERRUPT ROUTINE
======================
```
The CPU will be interrupted for every 20 ms. The interrupt service routine will push all registers to stack, 
and call an exit point at location 8012H. When power up this location is initialized to RET. 
The user can modify this vector to jump to his service routine if he wish
```
VIDEO ACCESS
============
```
On the Laser 500, the 8 64Kb DRAM chips are shared between the CPU and the video hardware. 
The CPU accesses RAM through the VLSI IC, which acts as a proxy and can insert wait states for the CPU 
if the RAM is already in use by the video hardware.

As seen by the VLSI, the 64 KB RAM occupies banks 4 to 7, the video hardware uses the RAM at the top of bank 7 
as video memory for both text and graphic modes (it can be configured to use bank 3 instead, 
but it is unpopulated on the Laser 500/700).

Depending on the mode you're using, you may or may not use the lower area of bank 7 as general-purpose RAM.

Video Mode    Video RAM     Free for user

TEXT40/80     3800-3FFF     0000-37FF
GR0/1/2       2000-3FFF     0000-1FFF
GR3/4/5       0000-3FFF     None

The offsets in the above table are given relative to the start of bank 7. The corresponding CPU address space 
range depends on what window the bank 7 is assigned to (if at all).
```
DISPLAY MODES
=============
```
I/O port 44H controls the display modes;

In textmode:
   Bit 0: 0=40 column, 1=80 column
   Bit 1: x
   Bit 2: x

In graphics mode:
   GR0
      Bit 0=x
      Bit 1=0
      Bit 2=1

   GR1
      Bit 0=1
      Bit 1=1
      Bit 2=1

   GR2
      Bit 0=0
      Bit 1=1
      Bit 1=1

   GR3
      Bit 0=1
      Bit 1=1
      Bit 2=0

   GR4
      Bit 0=0
      Bit 1=1
      Bit 2=0

   GR5
      Bit 0=x
      Bit 1=0
      Bit 2=0

   Bit 3; 0=page 3 and 1=page 7 in all modes

   Bit 4-7, is the backdrop color, 4=Blue, 5=Green, 6=Red, 7=Brightness

The ports are write only and can not be read back if I understand things right!

The difference between "2 of 16 colors" and "2 colors"(also of a 16 color palette) graphic modes is that in 
"2 of 16 colors" you can change color after every 8 pixels (every odd byte holds the info of the two colors) 
in the other case you can only change for the hole screen at once (write color info to port 45H)!
```

DISPLAY MODE FORMAT
===================
```
Display modes:
Lowest memory location is in left upper screen corner, highest in the right lower corner, 
All addresses are from the screen maps. 

Text modes 2K;
80 bytes/row
24 rows
F800-FFFF(FFA0H=beginning of row 24)
40 character, 16 colors (even byte=character code, odd byte=color)
80 character, 2 of 16 colors (back and foreground color is written to I/O port 45H)
Character= 5x7 dots in a 8x8 grid

The video memory is the last 16K. In 40 column text mode, the screen matrix starts at &HF800 and is arranged in a ZX Spectrum like order, where every even byte contains the character and every subsequent odd byte is a combination of background (low nybble) and foreground (high nybble).

Row 0: Bytes 0 .. 79
Row 1: Bytes 256 .. 335
Row 2: Bytes 512 .. 591
Row 3: Bytes 768 .. 847
Row 4: Bytes 1024 .. 1103
Row 5: Bytes 1280 .. 1359
Row 6: Bytes 1536 .. 1595
Row 7: Bytes 1792 .. 1871
Row 8: Bytes 80 .. 159
Row 9: Bytes 336 .. 415
Row 10: Bytes 592 .. 671
Row 11: Bytes 848 .. 927
Row 12: Bytes 1104 .. 1183
Row 13: Bytes 1360 .. 1439
Row 14: Bytes 1596 .. 1675
Row 15: Bytes 1872 .. 1951
Row 16: Bytes 160 .. 239
Row 17: Bytes 416 .. 495
Row 18: Bytes 672 .. 751
Row 19: Bytes 928 .. 1007
Row 20: Bytes 1184 .. 1263
Row 21: Bytes 1440 .. 1519
Row 22: Bytes 1676 .. 1755
Row 23: Bytes 1952 .. 2031

As you can see, the last 16 bytes in each block of 256 bytes are wasted in this scheme, a total of 7 * 16 = 112 bytes.

Graphic modes 8K;
All modes 40 bytes/line
E000-FFFF(FFA0=beginning of last line)
GR0 160H x 96V, 16 colors, (vertical resolution is in fact 192, but every odd line is a duplication of the last even line)
GR1 160 x 192, 2 of 16 colors
GR2  320x192, 2 colors

Graphics modes 16K;
All modes 80 bytes/line
C000-FFFF(FFA0H=beginning last line)
GR3 160x192, 16 colors
GR4  320x192, 2 of 16 colors(even byte=8 pixels(1=foreground color , 0=background color), odd byte=back and foreground color info for the 8 pixels)
GR5 640x192, 2 colors, every bit is an pixel(80 bytes=80x8=640 pixels), back and foreground color info written to I/O port 45H   
```
TRICKS
======
if you want a flashing cursor during INKEY$, you can issue the following commands:
```
POKE &H8013,64:POKE &H8014,10:REM PREPARE FLASHING CURSOR
POKE &H8012,&HC3:REM ENABLE FLASHING CURSOR
POKE &H8012,&HC9:REM DISABLE FLASHING CURSOR
```

How to relocate a Basic program: modify the &H8041 pointer to the
new address and POKE address-1, 0. Then use NEW or CLEAR.

INTERRUPT PART 2
================
```
The video chip triggers a maskable interrupt every start of frame.
It is an INT and interrupt mode 1 set, takes takes 13 clock cycles to reach &H0038

M1 cycle: 7 ticks: acknowledge interrupt and decrement SP
M2 cycle: 3 ticks: write high byte of PC onto the stack and decrement SP
M3 cycle: 3 ticks: write low byte onto the stack and to set PC to 0038H.

0038H in the ROM calls &H0A0C

&H0A0C ROM KERNEL Interrupt Routine which in turn calls also 8012H (user interrupt routine)

PRINTING CODES
==============
- CHR(24) begin line (cursor up key)
- CHR$(31) cls
- CHR$(28) home 0x1C
- CHR$(7) bell
- ESC A reverse off
- ESC B reverse on

QUIRKS
======
- CALL expression works only if expression == variable
- in MON LD (A000),A results in BAD OPERAND with arguments > 9999h
- in AND F0 results in BAD OPERAND, must write as "AND 0F0"
- in MON ld de, 1 / call exo_getbit is listed as "??"
- first byte in binary cassette file if FFh becomes F1h
- ' is REM

BANKS
=====

Banks C through F are for expansion ROM, made available through the expansion connector.
At startup, the BASIC ROM will look for a magic value (byte sequence AA, 55, E7, 18) in banks 2, C, D, E and F (in that order), and transfer execution to that ROM bank at offset 0x0004 if such a value is found (the bank gets mapped at 0000-3FFF in Z80 address space).

DISK
====
The manual mentions that the BASIC ROM can detect the presence of the disk unit interface by writing the I/O port 0x13 and reading back the result (this is the data buffer, so if the disk interface is present, you should read back the same value you've written).
And if the disk interface is present, the sector 0 of track 0, will be loaded to memory location 0xA200, and execution will resume at that location (after checking that the boot signature is there, I assume).
So it appears there is a least minimal support for the disk drive interface in the BASIC ROM, but it doesn't exclude loading a fuller support from an expansion ROM module.

CHARSET ROM
===========
containts the following character sets:
00 -    0 ($0000) english (standard)
01 - 2048 ($0800) nothing (vertical strips)
10 - 4096 ($1000) german
11 - 6144 ($1800) french
