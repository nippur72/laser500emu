This is an attempt to make a comprehensive list of all existing Laser 500 software. 
If there's something you wish to add please drop me a line.

- VT-DOS V1.1 (17-01-1986) extends the BASIC ROM with DOS commands like DIR, LOAD, etc. 
There is also a V1.0 that is single side only. The VT-DOS was rescued from Jaime 
collection (see below).

- CP/M (currently not available). The Laser 500 ran a standard CP/M 2.2 that was customized 
for the machine. Sadly, no copy of CP/M has preserved so at the moment it is not available.

# from Multididact B.V.

This is a collection of demos written by Multididact B.V. Venlo 
back in 1986 (Multididact was a subsidiary of Scheidegger which was the
the distributor of Laser 500 in Europe). They were rescued from defective
floppy disks owned by Jaime Soriano who kindly dumped them from the magnetic
media.
